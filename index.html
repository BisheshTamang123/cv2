<h3>Inspirational thoughts💙</h3>
<h4>You must understand the whole of life, not just one part of it.That is why you must read, that is why you must look at the skies, why you must sing, dance and write poems, and suffer, and understand, for all that is life.When people are facing a serious personal challenge they often say, “I need a miracle.” More often than not what they have in mind is some kind of Divine Intervention from God or Source who they believe is outside of them, out in the heavens somewhere.   This is mostly because of the unenlightened people’s  translation of the ancient Bible texts from the Hebrew to Greek and then to English.  Thus, Christians pray to God and spend their lives wondering why their prayers are never answered.   At Unity’s 9am MST Service this Sunday, I will point out these obvious flaws in the translation of the Bible.  Actually, millions of people could realize the answers to their prayers by changing one small incorrectly translated word in the Bible — the  phrase “Son of Man” to the “Son in Man”</h4>
